# React.js / Next.js / Chakra UI / TanStack Query interview assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), [`Chakra UI`](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-app-guide), and [`TanStack Query`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/installation).

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo on GitHub and clone it to your local PC.

2. Install Node.js

3. Run

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. Run
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## The task

The overall task of this assignment is to fetch data from an external API and create 2 pages which displays the data.

If you have any questions regarding the assignment you can contact Jacob or someone else from the team with any questions.

Good luck! 🙂

### Requirements

1. On the [/](/) route create a list of accordions displaying the information from the public API https://reqres.in/api/users. If needed, you can query the information for a single user on https://reqres.in/api/users/{id}.

   There's no need to validate the response from the API, but please think about how you would do it, as we may discuss it at the interview.

2. Clicking on the user's first name will redirect the user to [/profile/{id}](/profile/{id}) where ID is the user's ID.
   The [/profile/{id}](/profile/{id}) page will show the clicked user's information.

3. Use Next.js for routing, Chakra UI for components and styling and TanStack Query for querying the API. (If you feel more comfortable in another framework, you can also choose to use another tech stack that you prefer, but note that this project is already setup to use Chakra)

4. Push your changes to your repository and get ready to present your code at the interview by sharing your screen.

### Screenshots of example solution

You will be assesed on your ability to understand the requirements and your code quality.
Your solution does not have to look like the example solution as long as it fulfills the requirements in the [The task](#the-task) section.
